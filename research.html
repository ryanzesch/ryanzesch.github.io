                <h3>Neural Collision Fields for Triangle Primitives</h3>
                <p>We present neural collision fields as an alternative to contact point sampling in physics simulations. Our approach is built on top of a novel smoothed integral formulation for the contact surface patches between two triangle meshes. By reformulating collisions as an integral, we avoid issues of sampling common to many collision-handling algorithms. Because the resulting integral is difficult to evaluate numerically, we store its solution in an integrated neural collision field â€” a 6D neural field in the space of triangle pair vertex coordinates. Our network generalizes well to new triangle meshes without retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by implementing it as a constraint in a position-based dynamics framework and show that our neural formulation successfully handles collisions in practical simulations involving both volumetric and thin-shell geometries.

                <h3>NBD-Tree: Neural Bounded Deformation Tree for Collision Culling of Deformable Objects</h3>
                <p>We propose a novel machine learning-based approach for accelerating the broad phase of 3D collision detection for deformable objects. Our method, which we call the neural bounded deformation tree (NBD-Tree), allows us to cull away primitives for full-space deformable objects quickly. Unlike its classic, non-neural counterpart, the NBD-Tree is not limited to deformable objects that are constrained to work within the space of low-dimensional deformation modes, and instead works with an arbitrary set of deformations. With our approach, when the shape of the object changes at runtime, we use the low-dimensional deformation modes of the object only as the input to a neural network that calculates the necessary updates to the NBD-Tree. To further improve efficiency, we approximate these low-dimensional modes efficiently through clustering, which allows us to avoid going through every vertex of the mesh. We then rely on the network to overcome the potential errors stemming from these approximations. The NBD-Tree paves the way for interactive collision culling of large-scale, full-space deformable objects.

                <h3>Neural Collision Detection for Deformable Objects</h3>
                <p>We propose a neural network-based approach for collision detection with
                    deformable objects. Unlike previous approaches based on bounding volume
                    hierarchies, our neural approach does not require an update of the spatial
                    data structure when the object deforms. Our network is trained on the
                    reduced degrees of freedom of the object, so that we can use the same
                    network to query for collisions even when the object deforms. Our approach
                    is simple to use and implement, and it can readily be employed on the
                    GPU. We demonstrate our approach with two concrete examples: a haptics
                    application with a finite element mesh, and cloth simulation with a skinned
                    character.

                <h3>Spanning Trees</h3>
                <p>A common question in graph theory is to ask how many copies of one type of graph can appear within another.
                For my senior project, I researched disjoint spanning tree packings in almost balanced bipartite graphs.

                <h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
                <p>I am interested in computer graphics as a future research topic. Specifically, I'm interested in both ray tracing and
                    physics simulation. While I have not yet completed formal research on either topic, I have experience working on 
                    a ray tracer and a physics engine. See my projects page for more details!

                <p>As an undergraduate, I completed summer research studying the algebraic structure of a class of conic sections called Pell
                    conics. We studied the group structure on Pell conics, and learned about how they relate to elliptic curves. Follow this
